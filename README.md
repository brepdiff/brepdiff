## 🌟 Overview

**BrepDiff** is a diffusion-based generative model for 3D Boundary Representations (B-reps). It enables:

- **Single-stage generation** of valid and diverse CAD models
- **Direct editing** operations such as shape completion, merging, and interpolation
- **Efficient generation**, avoiding the complexity and limitations of cascaded pipelines

This repository provides code for training, evaluation, and editing with BrepDiff.
